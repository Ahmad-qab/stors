Description: This package is designed for sampling from uni- and multimodal
    distributions using very fast and efficient sampling techniques. In the 
    tails, the Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) algorithm has been implemented
    to cover heavy and light-tailed distributions. Meanwhile, the core of the
    distributions is covered by a nonparametric distribution, that is pre-built
    based on the target density values at certain grid points.
