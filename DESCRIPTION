Description: This package is designed for sampling from uni- and multimodal distributions using very fast and efficient sampling techniques.In the tails, the Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) algorithm has been implemented to cover heavy and light-tailed distributions.Meanwhile, the core of the distributions is covered by a nonparametric distribution, that is pre-built based on the target density values at certain grid points.
