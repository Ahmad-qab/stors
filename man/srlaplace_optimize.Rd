\usage{
srlaplace_optimize(
  mu = NULL,
  b = NULL,
  xl = NULL,
  xr = NULL,
  steps = 4091,
  proposal_range = NULL,
  theta = NULL,
  target_sample_size = 1000,
  verbose = FALSE,
  symmetric = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{(optional) Numeric, location parameter.}

\item{b}{(optional) Numeric, scale parameter.}

\item{xl}{Numeric. Left truncation bound for the target distribution. Defaults to \code{-Inf}, representing no left truncation.}

\item{xr}{Numeric. Right truncation bound for the target distribution. Defaults to \code{Inf}, representing no right truncation.}

\item{steps}{(optional) Integer. Desired number of steps in the proposal. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which means the number of steps is determined automatically during optimization.}

\item{proposal_range}{(optional) Numeric vector. Specifies the range for optimizing the steps part of the proposal. Defaults to \code{NULL}, indicating automatic range selection.}

\item{theta}{(optional) Numeric. A parameter for proposal optimization. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{target_sample_size}{(optional) Integer. Target sample size for proposal optimization. Defaults to \code{1000}.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, detailed optimization information, including areas and steps, will be displayed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{symmetric}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, the proposal will target only the right tail of the distribution, reducing the size of the cached proposal and making sampling more memory-efficient.
An additional uniform random number will be sampled to determine the sample's position relative to the mode of the distribution.
While this improves memory efficiency, the extra sampling may slightly impact performance, especially when the proposal efficiency is close to 1. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
The user does not need to store the returned value, because the package internally cashes the proposal. However, we explain here the full returned proposal for advanced users.

\description{
The \code{srlaplace_optimize()} function generates an optimized proposal for a targeted Laplace Distribution.
The proposal can be customized and adjusted based on various options provided by the user.
}
\details{
When \code{srlaplace_optimize()} is explicitly called:
\itemize{
\item A proposal is created and cached. If no parameters are provided, a standard proposal is created (\code{mu = 0}, \code{b = 1}).
\item Providing \code{mu} or \code{b} creates a custom proposal, which is cached for use with \code{srlaplace_custom()}.
\item The optimization process can be controlled via parameters such as \code{steps}, \code{proposal_range}, or
\code{theta}. If no parameters are provided, the proposal is optimized via brute force based on the.
\code{target_sample_size}.
}
}
\examples{
# Generate scalable proposal that with mu = 0 and b = 1, that has 4096 steps
scalable_proposal <- srlaplace_optimize(steps = 4096)

# Generate custom proposal that with mu = 2 and b = 1
scalable_proposal <- srlaplace_optimize(mu = 2, b = 1)
