\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of samples to draw.}

\item{mean}{Numeric. Mean of the target Normal distribution.}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the target Normal distribution.}

\item{x}{Numeric vector of length \eqn{n}. If provided, samples are stored in this vector to avoid memory 
allocation, improving performance for repeated sampling of the same size.}

\item{xl}{Scalar lower bounds.}

\item{xr}{Scalar upper bounds.}

\item{steps}{Optional Scalar integer indicating the number of steps in the proposal distribution.}

\item{grid_range}{Optional Vector of two elements specifying the start and end points for constructing steps along the x-axis.}

\item{theta}{Optional Scalar defining the pre-acceptance threshold,
dictating when the proposal steps constructing break based on the probability of pre-acceptance.}

\item{target_sample_size}{Scalar integer indicating the target sample size. The grid optimization process will take this number into account.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean if set to True, a table detailing the optimization areas and steps will be displayed during grid optimization.}

\item{symmetric}{Scalar can be set to distribution's mode to sample from one tiled grid.}

\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n} containing samples from the Normal distribution with the specified 
\code{mean} and \code{sd}.

\description{
The \code{srnorm()} function generates random samples from a Normal distribution using the STORS algorithm. 
It employs an optimized proposal distribution around the mode and Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) for the tails.
}
\details{
By default, \code{srnorm()} samples from a standard Normal distribution (\code{mean = 0}, \code{sd = 1}). 
The proposal distribution is pre-optimized at package load time using \code{srnorm_optimize()} with 
\code{steps = 4091}, creating a scalable grid centered around the mode. 

If \code{srnorm()} is called with custom \code{mean} or \code{sd} parameters, the samples are generated 
from the standard Normal distribution and scaled accordingly.

When \code{srnorm_optimize()} is explicitly called:
- A grid is created and cached. If no parameters are provided, a standard grid is created (\code{mean = 0}, \code{sd = 1}).
- Providing \code{mean} or \code{sd} creates a custom grid, which is cached for use with \code{srnorm_custom()}.
- The optimization process can be controlled via parameters such as \code{steps}, \code{grid_range}, or 
  \code{theta}. If no parameters are provided, the grid is optimized via brute force based on the 
  \code{target_sample_size}.

For efficiency, \code{srnorm_optimize()} also supports one-tailed grids via the \code{symmetric} argument. 
This reduces memory usage for symmetrical distributions, though sampling may be slower for large samples 
due to the additional computation required for symmetry checks.

The Normal distribution has the density:

\deqn{ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} }

where \eqn{\mu} is the mean and \eqn{\sigma} is the standard deviation.

\examples{
# Generate 10 samples from the standard Normal distribution
samples <- srnorm(10)
print(samples)

# Generate 10 samples using a pre-allocated vector
x <- numeric(10)
srnorm(10, x = x)
print(x)

# Generate 10 samples from a Normal distribution with mean = 2 and sd = 3
samples <- srnorm(10, mean = 2, sd = 3)
print(samples)
