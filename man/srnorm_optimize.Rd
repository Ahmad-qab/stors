\title{Optimizing Normal Distribution Grid}
\usage{
srnorm_optimize(
  mean = NULL,
  sd = NULL,
  xl = -Inf,
  xr = Inf,
  steps = NULL,
  grid_range = NULL,
  theta = NULL,
  target_sample_size = 1000,
  verbose = FALSE,
  symmetric = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean}{(optional) Numeric. Mean parameter of the Normal distribution. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which implies a scalable grid with \code{mean = 0}.}

\item{sd}{(optional) Numeric. Standard deviation of the target Normal distribution. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which implies a scalable grid with \code{sd = 1}.}

\item{xl}{Numeric. Left truncation bound for the target distribution. Defaults to \code{-Inf}, representing no left truncation.}

\item{xr}{Numeric. Right truncation bound for the target distribution. Defaults to \code{Inf}, representing no right truncation.}

\item{steps}{(optional) Integer. Desired number of steps in the proposal grid. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which means the number of steps is determined automatically during optimization.}

\item{grid_range}{(optional) Numeric vector. Specifies the range for optimizing the steps part of the proposal grid. Defaults to \code{NULL}, indicating automatic range selection.}

\item{theta}{(optional) Numeric. A parameter for grid optimization. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{target_sample_size}{(optional) Integer. Target sample size for grid optimization. Defaults to \code{1000}.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, detailed optimization information, including areas and steps, will be displayed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{symmetric}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, the proposal will target only the right tail of the distribution, reducing the size of the cached grid and making sampling more memory-efficient.
An additional uniform random number will be sampled to determine the sample's position relative to the mode of the distribution.
 While this improves memory efficiency, the extra sampling may slightly impact performance, especially when the grid efficiency is close to 1. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
The user does not need to store the returned value, because the package internally cashes the grid. However, we explain here the full returned grid for advanced users.

\description{
The \code{srnorm_optimize()} function generates an optimized proposal grid for a targeted Normal distribution.
 The grid can be customized and adjusted based on various options provided by the user.
}
\details{
When \code{srnorm_optimize()} is explicitly called:
\itemize{
 \item A grid is created and cached. If no parameters are provided, a standard grid is created (\code{mean = 0}, \code{sd = 1}).
 \item Providing \code{mean} or \code{sd} creates a custom grid, which is cached for use with \code{srnorm_custom()}.
 \item The optimization process can be controlled via parameters such as \code{steps}, \code{grid_range}, or
  \code{theta}. If no parameters are provided, the grid is optimized via brute force based on the.
  \code{target_sample_size}.
}
}
\examples{
# Generate scalable grid that with mean = 0 and sd = 1, that has 4096 steps
scalable_grid <- srnorm_optimize(steps = 4096)


# Generate custom grid that with mean = 2 and sd = 1
scalable_grid <- srnorm_optimize(mean = 2, sd = 1)
